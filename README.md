### Forecast taxi demand for given areas in New York City 

Predictions are made based on a preprocessed dataset of the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) data (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) containing hourly taxi demand from 01/2009 up to 06/2018 for all 263 taxi zones. 


Different forecasting methods are implemented:

- Baseline models

- ARIMA model (statsmodels)

- Feedforward-NN (KERAS)

- LSTM-NN (Keras)

- Autoencoder inspired by the work of "Deep and Confident Prediction for Time Series at Uber" by Zhu and Laptev (2017)
